# S-OS
> An Uber-Experimental, Daily-Driveable Linux Distro For Common-Lisp Development.

This project is inherently in personal-itch / learning-experience territory, I do not at all recommend you use this on your own machines at this point; If you do -- BACKUP YOUR DATA before. I take zero responsiblity for loss of data, or anything else. Be smart; Make good decisions.

Progress:

I'm slowly trying to move all of my main machines to Arch for S-OS; Currently that's a lots of musical-chairs with hardware. Hoping by the end of the month, I'll have all my main machines in a place that is least a "liveable". lol
